Most of my time online is tech-oriented, though we may even pass each other on a hiking trail in Appalachia. I live in the south-east U.S. and genuinely enjoy the summer humidity and heat.

Most content here is related to work skills, developed on the job or in the home lab. There are also some of my favorite pictures showcased, from various backpacking trips.
