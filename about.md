Most of my time online is tech-oriented, though we may even pass each other on a hiking trail in the Front Range. I recently moved to Denver, Colorado and am enjoying the many things it has to offer.

Most content here is related to work skills, developed on the job or in the home lab. There are also some of my favorite pictures showcased, from various backpacking trips.
